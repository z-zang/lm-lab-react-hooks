# useEffect

`useEffect` is a React Hook that lets you synchronize a component with an external system.

👉 Make yourself familiar with the files in this `hooks/use_effect` folder.

## The Mission

Your challenge is to fetch a "todo" from JSONPlaceholder.com and render the todo on your React app (underneath `<h1>useEffect</h1>` in some `<p>` tags is fine).

The URL you will need to call is: "https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/todos/1"

Write an asynchronous function to fetch the todo, then wrap this function in the `useEffect` hook and call it. You will then need to push this json into your state!

To remind yourself how to fetch using async/await, you can revisit the code you wrote for: https://github.com/techreturners/lm-lab-async-await-javascript/blob/main/docs/exercise001.md

See `use_effect/hints.md` if you get stuck!
