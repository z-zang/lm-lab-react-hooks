# React Hooks 🪝

In this repository you will find some starter code.

This exercise is about understanding the purpose of some common React hooks.

## Instructions

👉 Starting with whichever hook was assigned to your group first, work through each `hook` in the `hooks` folder

Make sure to follow the instructions in each README carefully.

### Important Notes 

- We recommend leaving `use_x` until the _end_ when you've completed the other hooks. This is because once you are familiar with how hooks work, creating a custom hook will be much easier.

- `useReducer` is an _extension_. Only attempt this when _every other activity_ has been completed. This is because the other hooks including custom ones are more common, so treat `useReducer` as a "nice to do if I have time", bonus kind of exercise. 🙂

If you complete the exercises there are extensions in `extension_exercises`

## Getting Started
